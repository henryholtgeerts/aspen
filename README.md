# aspen
The no-code inspired WordPress theme that puts the block editor front and center.

## Concept
Aspen is barebones and designed for a post-Gutenberg world. Leaving almost all aesthetic choices to the block editor, Aspen focuses on modern functionality, letting you build SPA-style websites without writing any code.
